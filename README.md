# 📂 Deepfake Image Detection
This project focuses on detecting deepfake images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Inspired by the Kaggle notebook by Srimanta Singha, this repository implements an image classification pipeline to distinguish between real and fake images with high accuracy (~96.91%).

🚀 Key Features:
Dataset: Deepfake images dataset from Kaggle.
Preprocessing: Efficient data loading and augmentation using TensorFlow and Keras.
Model: CNN architecture with dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
Training: Achieved high accuracy with balanced real and fake image classes.
Evaluation: Detailed performance metrics including accuracy and loss visualization.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python
TensorFlow & Keras
NumPy & Matplotlib
Kaggle GPU environment

📊 Project Goal:
Build a robust and scalable model for deepfake image detection, contributing to the ongoing fight against misinformation and AI-manipulated media.
